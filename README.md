## 🛠️ Technologies Used  

- C++ (Standard Library) 🧠  
- File Handling 📁  
- Console I/O 📤📥  
- Simple Text UI 🖥️  

---

## 🔄 Code Design & Logic  

### 💾 How Tasks Are Stored  
Each task contains:
- Task ID (auto-incremented)
- Task description
- Status (pending or completed)

Tasks are stored in a vector and saved in a text file (`tasks.txt`), ensuring persistence between sessions.

### ✏️ How Editing Works  
When updating a task, the user selects the task ID and provides the new text. The program validates the ID and updates accordingly.

### 💥 Error Handling  
- Invalid task numbers are handled gracefully  
- The program checks for file existence and creates it if missing  
- Ensures file data remains consistent and readable

## 🧠 Team - Bug Busters 🏆  

This project was developed by **Bug Busters**, a passionate and dedicated team from **Dhirubhai Ambani University (DAU)**. From concept to code, we aimed to create a simple yet efficient task manager to boost productivity and learn file handling in C++.

💡 Our journey involved brainstorming sessions, debugging marathons, and countless refinements. We implemented dynamic task management, data persistence, and a clean menu-driven UI from scratch.

This app is more than a project—it's a toolkit for organization and a lesson in clean code. 💻💪
